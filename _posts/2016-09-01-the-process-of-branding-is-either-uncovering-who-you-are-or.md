**The process of branding is either uncovering who you are, or inventing who you want to be.**

At every interaction a customer has with your brand lies an impression. It could be big, small, seemingly insignificant, or life changing. Add all of these interactions up across time, and that is what your true brand is. These interactions are your opportunity to reinforce the brand you choose to craft.

Take control of your story... or others will.
